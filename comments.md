<!-- This project uses route groups in Next Js.
Most of the code is written in the app folder and if you make a new folder and use page.tsx you need to do export default instead of export const
route group means you can use parenthesis inside a folder in order to not use the name of the folder in the link.
Authentication is written using the square brackets, this gives you access to all routes and every callback url and everything that it needs to redirect.
